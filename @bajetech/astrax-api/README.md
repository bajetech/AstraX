# AstraX API

This package builds a wrapper around the messaging system used to interact with
the AstraX wallet (a web browser extension). Client applications will be able to
install this package from npm and then integrate with AstraX using dev-friendly
methods like `getPublicKey`.

Both the AstraX web extension and AstraX API are built to support transactions
on the [DigitalBits](https://digitalbits.io) blockchain network.

## Important Notice

The AstraX web extension is currently in-development and scheduled for a
September 2021 release. Although this package can be downloaded and used
straight away it will become useful when the web extension becomes available.

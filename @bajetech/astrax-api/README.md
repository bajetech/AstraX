# AstraX API

This package builds a wrapper around the messaging system used to interact with
the AstraX chrome web extension. Client applications will be able to install this package
from npm and then integrate with AstraX using dev-friendly methods like `getPublicKey`.

Both the AstraX chrome extension and AstraX API are built to support transactions on the
[DigitalBits](https://digitalbits.io) blockchain network.

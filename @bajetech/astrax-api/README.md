# AstraX API

This package builds a wrapper around the messaging system used to interact with
the AstraX web extension. Client applications will be able to install this package
from npm and then integrate with AstraX using dev-friendly methods like `getPublicKey`.

AstraX API is a Derivative Work, based on [Stellar Development Foundation's](https://www.stellar.org/foundation)
[Freighter API](https://github.com/stellar/freighter), but re-factored to operate on
the [DigitalBits](https://digitalbits.io) blockchain network.
